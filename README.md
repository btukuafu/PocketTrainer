# PocketTrainer

Problem Statement: We want to provide lifters with a device that can track their barbell path, speed, balance, range of motion, and repetitions. Users will be able to view their numbers via our app and be able to share their numbers and progress with friends and/or trainers in a strava-like app for lifters. This app can be made available to everyone to help sell the hardware that is needed for the actual tracking of lifts. If time permits, we may also make a backend feedback generator for the user to get feedback on their lifting.
